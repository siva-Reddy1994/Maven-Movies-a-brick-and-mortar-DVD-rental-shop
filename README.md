### Mavenmovies Database Analysis
This repository contains my analysis on the Mavenmovies database, which includes various tables such as actor, film, customer, and more. The analysis was done using MySQL commands and concepts such as JOINS, group by, and subqueries, and includes basic to advanced level queries.

### About the Database
The Mavenmovies database was obtained from OdinSchool, where I am pursuing a Data Science course. The database includes various tables with sample data that can be used for practicing MySQL commands and concepts.

@mavenmovies_queries.sql: SQL file containing a series of queries used to explore and extract insights from the Mavenmovies database
README.md: This file

### Usage
The mavenmovies_queries.sql file contains a series of queries that explore and extract insights from the Mavenmovies database. The queries cover a range of topics and difficulty levels, and are intended to be used as a learning resource for practicing MySQL commands and concepts. To use the queries, simply import the file into a MySQL server and run the queries.

#### Conclusion
Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to practice my skills in SQL and data analysis. I hope that this repository will be useful to others who are learning SQL or looking for a database to practice on. Please feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
